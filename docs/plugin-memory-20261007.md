# Plugin background work and memory investigation, 2026-10-07

Language deliveries were held after three kernel OOM events in QLO2. The third
occurred without a build or test running. User notes, layouts, recovery records,
leases, journals and backups remain preserved.

A native 10-second Electron CPU profile and a separate 20-second application
counter sample are retained outside the vault at
`/home/ubuntu/backups/send-to-t3-code/memory-20261007`.
The counter sample observed 956 project-embed preparation calls, 17,745,278
Markdown characters, 231 journal audit requests and up to 26 overlapping audits.
The fresh renderer continued to use approximately one CPU core. A read-only
Windows process sample also found sustained Obsidian CPU activity. These are
measured background costs; they do not establish that every OOM has one cause.

The change caches image-reference syntax, not resources or authorization, under
a one-million-character / sixteen-entry limit. Ordinary reads with no image
opener skip Markdown parsing. Changed text invalidates its entry. Project paths
and signed-image expiration are still checked on each preparation.

Overlapping journal reads share one full audit for the same response. At most
four journal audits run simultaneously. Every audit still checks the identity of
every revision, and changed revision bodies still undergo hash-chain validation.
Callers still receive independent state copies. No journal is deleted or
shortened, and no integrity check is replaced by a directory timestamp.

Automatic host maintenance audits one completed response per five seconds and
avoids repeating an unchanged active lease's journal audit within five seconds.
Active writer polling continues each tick; changed lease revisions bypass that
maintenance delay. Newly completed or changed terminal leases also bypass the
cold-history budget, including native rename and delivery acknowledgements.
Explicit recovery scans retain their original batch size.

Regression coverage checks unchanged/changed image references, cache size/count
bounds, audit coalescing and concurrency, independent read results, historical
rotation and active delivery. Existing tamper, truncation, symlink, recovery and
native-save tests remain required. The immutable release is complete only after
fresh native reload, delivery/link checks and retained memory observations.

A guarded, device-local plugin pause preserved the saved enable list and exact
open-note hash. Over twenty seconds, renderer CPU measured 7.30% of one core and
RSS fell to 501,124 KiB, compared with approximately 1.5 GB before the pause.
The final reviewed build and complete suite passed 976 JavaScript/TypeScript
tests and 11 Python tests. Native post-release observations are recorded in the
immutable release receipt and its retained evidence, not inferred from tests.
